# House-price-prediction-using-Multivariate-Linear-Regression
Devising a model using the given dataset of size of house, number of bedroom and their respective prices to get the accurate prediction of price of any house in future with any size s and n number of rooms, using Multivariate Linear Regression. The gradient descent algorithm, function for normal equation and cost computation function are generalised to accomodate any number of features. This can be used to model any other multivariate hypothesis. All the features are normalised by substracting the mean from the data and dividing by the respective standard deviation.
